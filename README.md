# 🚀 Surviving Mars Board Game - 3D Printed Edition

Welcome to **Surviving Mars Boardgame 3D Printed**! This repository aims to document the progress of designing and developing a 3D-printed version of the *Surviving Mars* board game. Inspired by futuristic Mars colonies, resource management, and exploration themes, this project will evolve over the next 687 days as new components and tools are created.

---

## 🌌 Project Overview

This is **Day 1 of 687**, and the goal is to create **3D printable game components** for a Mars-themed board game, such as:

- **Rovers** for exploration and resource gathering
- **Drone Units** for automation and building assistance
- **Buildings and Domes** inspired by futuristic Martian colonies

Currently, the focus is on brainstorming ideas, prototyping simple designs, and scripting tools for processing 3D assets.

## 🛠 Planned Features

### 1. **3D Printable Game Components** (In Progress)
- **Drone Units**
  - Compact, modular design for easy printing.
  - Small hover thrusters, robotic arms, and functional details.

- **Rovers**
  - Six-wheeled, futuristic rovers with solar panels and tools.

- **Buildings**
  - Modular and futuristic architecture inspired by Mars colonies.

### 2. **Blender Automation Scripts** (Planned)
- Tools for importing, preparing, and exporting 3D assets:
  - Import GLB models into Blender.
  - Bake textures to vertex colors.
  - Check 3D printability (manifold geometry).
  - Export OBJ files optimized for 3D printing.

---

## 📚 Current Status

### ✅ Completed So Far:
- **Initial Conceptual Designs** for Rovers and Drones.
- Basic Blender scripts for vertex color baking and OBJ export.

### 🔄 Work in Progress:
- Prototyping **simple game pieces** for Rovers and Drones.
- Designing modular buildings inspired by the *Surviving Mars* aesthetic.
